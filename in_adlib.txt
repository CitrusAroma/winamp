Description:
------------
AdPlug is a Winamp input plugin. Winamp is a fast, high-fidelity audio player
for Windows (get it at www.winamp.com). AdPlug plays music, originally
composed for the AdLib (OPL2) audio board, on top of an OPL2 emulator or by
using the real hardware. No OPL chip is required for playback.

Supported formats:
------------------
AdPlug implements unique file replayers for each supported format in order to
achieve the best possible replay quality. Below is a list of all currently
supported file formats along with information about possible replay issues.

- A2M: AdLib Tracker 2 by subz3ro
  - Unimplemented commands (version 1-4): FF1 - FF9, FAx - FEx
  - Unimplemented commands (version 5-8): Gxy, Hxy, Kxy - &xy
  - In version 5-8 files, instrument panning & the flags byte is ignored
  - Only SixPack or uncompressed files are supported
- AMD: AMUSIC Adlib Tracker by Elyssis
- CMF: Creative Music File Format by Creative Technology
  - Unimplemented: AdLib rhythm mode
- D00: EdLib by Vibrants
  - Bugs: Hard restart SR sometimes sound wrong
- HSC: HSC Adlib Composer by Hannes Seifert, HSC-Tracker by Electronic Rats
- HSP: HSC Packed by Number Six / Aegis Corp.

- SA2: Surprise! Adlib Tracker 2 by Surprise! Productions
  - Unimplemented: Version 7 files (i don't have any)

Installation:
-------------
If you got the PiMPed version, everything should already be in place.

For the classic zipped version, you need to extract the file "in_adlib.dll"
from the archive to your Winamp plugin directory (on most machines this will
be Winamp\Plugins).

Usage:
------
You can now open a supported file in Winamp. Doubleclicking on the song name
scroller displays some infos about the currently playing file. AdPlug should
automatically configure itself to the best replay conditions.

Configuration:
--------------
Configure AdPlug by doubleclicking on it in the
Options|Preferences|Plug-ins|Input dialog (press Ctrl+P to go to the
preferences dialog). The configuration should be a breeze, but there are
some options that i need to explain further.

In the "Options" group, there are 3 options to set:
"Autodetect Songend": Turning off this option makes the songs play endlessly -
preserving the original loop points - just like the old modplayers did. Note
that you can obviously forget about using playlists when this feature is
turned off.

"Fast Seeks": This is only needed for hardware OPL2 replay. If seeking takes
too long on your machine, you can turn on this option to make it significantly
faster. The drawback with it is that the replayer won't preserve the module
commands that would normally have been played in the time you skipped and the
module may sound wrong after the seek.

"Bypass all Hardware Tests": With this option turned on, the plugin won't
complain about a nonexistant or already in use OPL2 board anymore. This can be
useful to force the hardware replay on soundcards for which the OPL2
autodetection fails.

Known Problems:
---------------
The hardware replay won't work with SB AWE32/64 soundcards. Although the
plugin will detect their OPL chip properly, there will be no sound output.
This is a driver issue with the Creative FM driver. Until there is a way
around it, AWE users have to stick to emulation mode.

Some files (especially SA2) will sound distorted through the emulator. This is
a well-known problem with software mixing, hearable when the composer plays
the same sound on multiple channels. Hardware mixing is unaffected by this
issue.

Legal:
------
AdPlug is released under the terms and conditions of the LGPL. A recent copy
of the LGPL can be found at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html.
