AdPlug/Winamp To Do List:
-------------------------
- fix: subsong selection does not work if song is not playing. This hampers
  selection of ADL files, which have a lot of subsongs with zero length.
- fix: playlist sometimes fails in background
- fix: make porttalk only occupy ports ADLIB_BASEPORT and ADLIB_BASEPORT + 1,
       instead of the whole range. [dynamite]

[winamp]
- fix: not all extensions winamp uses in file selection dialog 

[xmplay]
- fix: xad.rat player fails
